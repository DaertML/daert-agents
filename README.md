# DAERT Agents
We are bringing agents to open source and smaller LLMs; all the work developing and improving agents at Daert will be found in this repository.

## Getting started
In order to get started with playing around with the Daert Agents, we recommend you install llama.cpp, following the steps, as described in https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/, as llama.cpp
is the only supported LLM engine at the moment. We are planning to bring other LLM frameworks, that you can use to run your experiments in, like oobabooga's text_generation_web_ui;
or other kind of LLM ecosystems, like a REST endpoint where you have your LLM running, gpt4all... just to mention a few.

## What kind of agents are you working on?
We are working on agents that can do software development tasks/data analysis/cybersecurity related tasks...; somehow we do not limit to this, and we are planning to bring other use cases like
simulations meant to develop stories, play text based role games...
