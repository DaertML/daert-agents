Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Write the following Python code:
- Initialize a zeroed matrix using numpy of 16 by 4 called "qtable"
- Initialize variables: episodes=1000, alpha=0.5, gamma=0.9
- Create an empty list called "outcomes"
- Loop for the number of steps and do the following:
  - Run "state = environment.reset()"
  - Run "state = state[0]"
  - initialize done=False
  - Add "Failure" to the outcomes list
  - Loop while not done:
    - action = argmax value in qtable[state]
    - if action <= 0 then run "environment.action_space.sample()
    - Run a step, and get the values of "new_state", "reward", "done", "info" and "prob"
    - Run without change "qtable[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(qtable[new_state]) - qtable[state, action])"
    - Update state with new_state
    - if reward then run outcomes[-1]="Success"
    - else continue
    - print qtable
    - End code

### Response:
